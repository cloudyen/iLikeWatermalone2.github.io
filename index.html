			<p> Hello and welcome to my website. I'm currently attending Canyon Crest Academy in the 10th grade, and I guess you 
				can associate me with the stereotypical Asian, minus the intellect and the glasses. I'm pretty much on the computer 
				24/7, either doing homework or playing games. In my free time, I enjoy playing an online MOBA called League of Legends, 
				which you probably have heard of at least once in your life. Occasionally, I pull out some anime/manga and start watching/reading, 
				but I wouldn't exactly consider myself a weeb, since anime, in my eyes at least, is just another TV show. I have been 
				painting since I was 8 years old, and the sad part is I'm probably still betterat using color pencils over a paintbrush. 
				I used to play the piano from 6th-9th grade, but gradually lost interestto the point that I didn't even want to play anymore. 
				I don't attend any clubs or sports at Canyon Crest Academy,but I used to play rec football (American) when I was in 5th grade.
