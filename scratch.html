			<p> Name Project </p>
			<img src = "images/name.png" width="480" height = "305">
			<p> The purpose of this activity was to create a program that would display my name on it.
			My name had to have 3 unique animations and every letter had to have at least 1 of those 3 
			effects. The name was supposed to start animating when the green flag was clicked, and extra
			credit was offered if you made the animations reset when the green flag was clicked. I made
			my entire name flash random colors and made some letters rotate in certain directions after
			a certain amount of time. </p>
			<p style = "color:yellow"> Concepts Learned</p>
		<ul style = "color: yellow">
			<li> Using event blocks: When space pressed, when green flag clicked, etc. </li>
			<li> Loops: Forever statement, repeat forever, etc. </li>
			<li> Sprites: Used Scratch's sprites for the letters in my name </li>
		</ul>
			
			<p> Computer Buying Project </p>
			<img src = "images/derek.png" width = "344" height = "270">
			<p> My partner Ryan Wang and I made a short animation where our friend Derek Wen goes and buys
			a new computer. He gets offered a few gaming computers that each have their own unique properties.
			We made him pick a computer that we thought he would have gotten in real life. The purpose of this
			activity was to learn a little bit more about a computer's individual parts </p>
			<p style = "color:yellow"> Concepts Learned </p>
			<ul style = "color: yellow">
				<li> Animation: Although I only made the building blocks of whatever we needed to complete the
				project (sprites, sounds, etc.), I learned a lot about switching scenes by watching Ryan animate
				on a daily basis </li>
			</ul>
			
			<p> Scratch Final Project: </p>
			<img src = "images/ship.png" width = "477" height = "361">
			<p> My final project for Scratch was a game where you're captaining a warship, and you're trying to kill
			multiple enemy ships, and eventually the boss. I made it so that the boss spawns when you kill a certain
			ship, but you don't know which one. As long as you kill the boss, you win, regardless of how many more 
			mini ships there are. </p>
			<p style = "color:yellow"> Concepts Learned </p>
		<ul style = "color:yellow">
			<li> If statements: I used if statements to determine if you lost the game (hp = 0) or if you won (bossHP = 0)</li>
			<li> Random: I made it so that the main character moves with WASD keys, and the enemy ships would constantly
			be moving around the map towards random coordinates. </li>
